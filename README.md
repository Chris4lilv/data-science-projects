# **Data-science-projects**
<p><h2>This is a repository where I put all of my machine learning as well as data analysis code from either coursework or self-learning.<h2></p>

## **Algorithms**
<p><h3>This part help me to better understand each machine learning algorithm by implementing it using python. <br><em>Reference: Machine Learning In Action by Peter Harrington</em></h3><p>

    > <span style="font-family:Arial">Idea: for each point, find the distances between current point and all other points in the dataset. Then find the smallest k ones and calculate frequency of their categories. Finally use the category with most frequency as the predicted frequency of current point.
* ### [DecisionTree](https://github.com/Chris4lilv/data-science-projects/blob/master/algorithm%20implementation/Decision%20Tree.ipynb)
    ><span style="font-family:Arial">Idea: Find the feature that play the most important role in classification by calculating information gain, then split the dataset until we reach the point where the data under the branch belongs to a single category
